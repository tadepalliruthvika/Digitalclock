# Digitalclock
The Digital Clock is a simple GUI-based Java application that displays the current system time in hours, minutes, and seconds.
It is built using Java Swing, which provides the graphical user interface components, and uses the SimpleDateFormat and Calendar classes to fetch and format the current time.

The clock updates automatically every second, creating a real-time display effect.
This project demonstrates the concepts of loops, multithreading (via Thread.sleep()), GUI design, and date-time handling in Java.

It‚Äôs an ideal beginner project for students learning Java GUI programming and real-time updates.
The interface is clean and minimal, showing the time in a bold digital font on a dark background.
